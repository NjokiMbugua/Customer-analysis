# Customer-analysis
Working as a consultant Data scientist for Kira Plastinina to come up with the best model for customer analysis.Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.
The ecommerce dataset (http://bit.ly/EcommerceCustomersDataset) was used for this project.
